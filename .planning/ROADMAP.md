# Roadmap: Bespren Visual AAA+ & Map Redesign

## Overview

Brownfield visual + map-composition milestone. Core value: at 480×270 the world reads as authored places with a visible salvage loop — never as generated scatter on a grid. Phase 1 is audit and a written redesign contract only; no world-authoring code. Later phases consume that contract as composition data, fill districts and pockets, place unique set pieces, prove the 30s loop in captures, then lift remaining surfaces on the skeleton that already reads. Gameplay systems, 14×14 extents, 480×270 `canvas_items`, one weather overlay, HDR 2D off, and no runtime 3D stay frozen the whole way.

**Locked across every phase:** no new gameplay systems; no HDR 2D; no extra fullscreen passes; no runtime 3D / GLTF / Node3D; no shadow-casting 2D lights; no shrinking or growing ±14,336; no world-space district nameplates; wild non-tree frames stay unpromoted until a hosted-pocket 1× veto.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Map Audit + Redesign Contract** - Census the 14×14 map and write the contract; zero world-authoring code
- [ ] **Phase 2: Authored Skeleton** - Consume composition data for paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks inside locked extents
- [ ] **Phase 3: Readable Road Hierarchy** - Asphalt spine, dirt branch, and wilderness perimeter read as the loop's path at 1×
- [ ] **Phase 4: District Jobs** - Kaupunki choke, Ostari salvage, Kylät quiet, Metsä threat read without labels
- [ ] **Phase 5: Camp Clearing + Salvage Pockets** - Camp is a clearing; 87 IDs sit in co-authored pockets
- [ ] **Phase 6: Hero Set Pieces** - Unique silhouettes at nodes; adjacent variety by construction, not `index % 8`
- [ ] **Phase 7: Capture Cameras + Canonical Gates** - Cameras on loop beats; noise floor measured; simulation untouched
- [ ] **Phase 8: 1× Loop, Named Places, Way-Home** - Stranger-point proves the 30s loop and way home with minimap hidden
- [ ] **Phase 9: Visual Lift on the Skeleton** - Remaining surfaces lifted on places that already read, still on the mobile bar

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Map Audit + Redesign Contract

**Goal**: Team has a written redesign contract for the 14×14 world, grounded in a live audit, before anyone edits world layout
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CONT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Reviewer can open a `docs/` redesign contract that names camp, roads, district jobs, landmarks, salvage/threat pockets, 30s-loop beats, way-home language that is not the minimap, exclusion volumes, and capture cameras that will prove the loop
  2. Reviewer can read an audit of the current map — captures, density, pocket/obstacle overlaps, 1× unreadables — quoting live counts, not stale foundation docs
  3. Phase 1 diff contains no `src/world/` layout edits, no new atlas regions in `src/world/`, and no scenery/cover/resource count changes

**Plans:** 2/3 plans executed

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Live 14×14 census in docs/WORLD_MAP_AUDIT.md (seed, camp, eight routes, density, pocket 2, 1× unreadables, 25 captures)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Locked redesign contract in docs/WORLD_MAP_REDESIGN_CONTRACT.md (camp, roads, shout nouns, 30s beats, exclusions, named cameras)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [ ] 01-03-PLAN.md — CONT-01 proof: heading checklist, live-constant table vs RESEARCH census, empty src/world/ git path filter

### Phase 2: Authored Skeleton

**Goal**: Player traverses an authored skeleton stored as composition data, still inside 14×14 / ±14,336
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: CONT-02, SKEL-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Player can move the existing 14×14 / ±14,336 playable world whose paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks come from composition data — not biome cell IDs or seeded scatter
  2. Camp, roads, and colliding landmarks sit at contract positions; extents are unchanged
  3. Reviewer can inspect a shipped composition Resource that `BesprenWorldMap2D` consumes; GameWorld, CoopSession, gather rules, and the peer-one RPC surface stay the same

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 3: Readable Road Hierarchy

**Goal**: Player can read the road hierarchy at 1× as the salvage loop's path
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: ROAD-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Player can tell asphalt spine from dirt branch from wilderness perimeter at 1× without a label and without the minimap
  2. A 480×270 frame of the home road shows "this is the way" through width, edge, and negative space — not only as polylines in code
  3. Roads remain ground-layer presentation; collision and flow stay canonical

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: District Jobs

**Goal**: Player can tell each district's job at 1× without a label
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: DIST-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Player entering Kaupunki can tell it is a city choke (dense shells, sightline breaks) without a label
  2. Player entering Ostari can tell it is mall salvage (collapsed commercial place, narrow approach) without a label
  3. Player entering Kylät can tell it is village quiet (yards, timber, rest rhythm) without a label
  4. Player entering Metsä can tell it is forest threat (canopy wall, sparse mass, camp as the clearing) without a label

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 5: Camp Clearing + Salvage Pockets

**Goal**: Camp reads as a clearing and the 87 gather nodes live in authored salvage pockets
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: SLVG-01, CAMP-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Player still gathers the same 87 IDs with unchanged 3–5 step / one-unit rules, but nodes sit in authored salvage pockets instead of uniform 84-sector scatter
  2. Camp reads as a clearing: negative space and landmark exclusion are visible; the refuge is not a stamp in the forest
  3. Pocket tables and obstacle tables match in the same change — no new pocket/shell overlap beyond the recorded unhostable tripwire

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 6: Hero Set Pieces

**Goal**: Nodes and landmarks read as unique places a co-op partner can name, not repeating wallpaper
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: SETP-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Player can call out distinct hero set pieces at nodes and landmarks (mall gate, city choke, village yard, forest satellites) without world-space nameplates
  2. Adjacent dress does not read as `index % 8` wallpaper; neighboring instances differ by construction, not a per-instance coin
  3. Forbidden wild non-tree frames stay out of the shipping world

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 7: Capture Cameras + Canonical Gates

**Goal**: Capture cameras sit on the 30s-loop beats, noise is measured, and presentation has not written simulation
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: PROOF-01, PROOF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. World-render cameras look at the contract's camp, home-road, landmarks, salvage pockets, and threat approaches — not leftover hardcoded scrap piles
  2. Two identical capture runs exist as the noise floor before any visual diff is blamed on art
  3. Headless world-map and smoke gates are green after layout changes; collision, flow, gather, and RPC stay canonical
  4. A visual veto can fail a numeric pass; on-disk captures match live camp position

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 8: 1× Loop, Named Places, Way-Home

**Goal**: A stranger can point at the 30s loop, named places, and the way home at 480×270 with the minimap hidden
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: LOOP-01, READ-01, READ-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A stranger looking at 480×270 captures can point the 30s loop in order: camp → readable road → named landmark → salvage pocket → threat → back
  2. A stranger can point at camp, road, landmark, salvage pocket, and threat as named places with no world-space labels
  3. From each district, the way home reads from roads, silhouettes, and the camp Amber Gold weenie with the minimap hidden

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 9: Visual Lift on the Skeleton

**Goal**: Every remaining visual surface is lifted on the skeleton that already reads, still on the 480×270 mobile bar
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: VISL-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Reviewer at 1× can see a lift of terrain, props, foliage, structures, lighting, actors, camp, dashboard/HUD, VFX, and shaders on Phase 8 camera beats — authored places plus unique set pieces, not a prettier stamp grid
  2. Mobile contract still holds: one fullscreen pass, HDR 2D off, no runtime 3D, no extra custom fullscreen pass, Base Core remains the only dominant Amber Gold
  3. Existing focused visual gates still pass on the new places

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
