# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-18)

**Core value:** At 480×270, the world reads as authored places with a visible salvage loop — never as generated scatter on a grid.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — map-audit-redesign-contract

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (map-audit-redesign-contract) — VERIFYING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-09-19 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 11%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4.7min
- Total execution time: 0.23 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 14min | 4.7min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 6min, 3min, 5min
- Trend: stable docs-only

| Phase 01 P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 01 P03 | 5min | 2 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1 is docs-only. CONT-01 alone. No `src/world/` layout edits.
- CONT-02 lives in Phase 2 (first phase that may move camp/roads). Extents stay 14×14.
- Fine split: skeleton → roads → district jobs → pockets → set pieces → capture proof → 1× verdict → visual lift.
- VISL-01 after the skeleton reads (Phase 8). No HDR 2D, extra fullscreen passes, runtime 3D, or new gameplay.
- [Phase 01]: Audit quotes live .gd constants; WORLD_MAP_FOUNDATION.md 576/23/150 are drift, not rewritten — D-26: census from src/world and tests, not foundation prose
- [Phase 01]: No camp dirt spur exists today; D-02 remains a contract invention — Eight routes; none terminate at (9950, 2400)
- [Phase 01]: Wilderness pocket 2 vs OstariSouthShell recorded; MAXIMUM_UNHOSTABLE_POCKETS stays 1 — D-19: name the overlap, do not move the pocket
- [Phase 01]: Wild-atlas runtime_promotion remains forbidden_pending_human_visual_veto; no Rect2 copied into src — T-01-02: audit must not promote forbidden frames
- [Phase 01]: LAYOUT_VERSION 2 and WORLD_BUILD_SEED 0xB35E7E frozen this plan — D-28: Phase 1 does not bump layout or seed
- [Phase 01]: Dirt spur is a Phase 2 route; contract uses relative language, no Vector2 join — D-02 remains a contract invention; no frozen spur join coordinates
- [Phase 01]: Exactly five shout nouns; east village unnamed; mall gate is a missing-tooth gap — D-11 D-18; landmark table five rows not six
- [Phase 01]: Fifteen camera IDs specified; tests/world_render_validation.gd untouched — D-27 cameras are table IDs for Phase 7
- [Phase 01]: WorldCompositionContract named as Phase 2 type; no .tres this plan — D-25 docs-only; Resource is Phase 2
- [Phase 01]: Duplicate WorldBackgroundDecor2D.CAMP_POSITION is a Phase 2 grep trap — Grepping only STARTING_CAMP_POSITION misses the decor literal
- [Phase 01]: CONT-01 proven by heading checklist, live-constant table vs RESEARCH, empty src/world/ path filter — D-25 D-26 D-27 D-28
- [Phase 01]: LAYOUT_VERSION remains typed const 2; WORLD_BUILD_SEED remains 0xB35E7E — D-28: Phase 1 does not bump layout or seed
- [Phase 01]: Fifteen camera IDs specified; tests/world_render_validation.gd and .tscn untouched — D-27 cameras are table IDs for Phase 7

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: freeze `.tres` schema before WorldMap2D consumption; grep `STARTING_CAMP_POSITION` consumers when camp moves.
- Phase 9: fir canopy mass and salvage-atlas promotion stay art vetoes, not builder work. Device thermals out of this milestone.
