"""Bake the Poly Haven wild and salvage families into mobile-ready 2D sprites.

Two things make this renderer different from its three siblings, and both are
deliberate.

It has no workshop `.blend`. The district, nature, and local families each
require one, because their sources arrived through Blender MCP and the saved
scene is the only record of what was imported. These sources arrived through
the documented public API instead, so the source contract is
`vault/<family>/_fetch_manifest.json`: every file with its SHA-256, its
polyhaven.com asset page, and its CC0 declaration. That is a stronger
provenance chain than a binary scene - it is diffable, and it reproduces on a
machine that has never run Blender MCP. Nothing else about the promotion rule
changes: no mesh, PBR graph, authoring light, or Node3D reaches `res://`.

And it bakes several yaw variants per model. A 2D sprite cannot be turned at
runtime, so a single frame per source is a single silhouette forever - which
is exactly the shortage this family exists to fix. Rendering one pine from
three headings costs three frames and yields three trees that do not read as
the same stamp repeated down a treeline. Frames are 256 px rather than the
384 px the building families use, because these subjects are small on a
480x270 screen; that trades a resolution nobody can see for 2.25x the
vocabulary in the same atlas footprint.

The stage itself is imported from the district renderer rather than copied.
Sharing one camera direction, one three-light rig, one Freestyle silhouette,
and one AgX look is what keeps a new family from reading as a different game.

    # This exists for a source that ships its own ground. `fir_tree_01` models
    # a root mound into the trunk primitive - about 0.35 m tall and 0.6 to
    # 0.78 m in radius under a bole of 0.17 to 0.20 m - and under the
    # 70-degree tree camera that flare renders as a lit disc the trunk stands
    # on. The runtime draws the contact it wants as `GroundShadow`, so the
    # baked mound was a second contact under the first, lit where the other
    # is shaded, and no grade downstream can remove a shape. See
    # [const FIR_GROUND_CLIP] for the measurement that chose the height.
    #
    # The mechanism is a holdout, not a cut: a plane at this height with
    # `is_holdout` set writes alpha 0 wherever it is the first surface the
    # camera sees, and a camera looking down sees it before everything under
    # it. EEVEE in Blender 5.0 honours the flag - confirmed by render rather
    # than by the manual. The plane casts no shadow and is never part of the
    # subject, so bounds, framing, exposure and every luma measured in
    # [func generate] are taken from the subject alone, exactly as they are
    # for a source that declares nothing here. It is placed after framing
    # and removed before the next unit; see [func _place_ground_clip].

    # intersection with the bole, an ellipse whose width tapers to nothing
    # over about half its diameter of rows - it is the trunk's own diameter
    # at the clip height and not a mound remnant. And the runtime fits the
    # cropped frame's longer edge to `collision_radius * 4.35`, so a shorter
    # crop delivers a tree of the same height and slightly greater width, not
    # a smaller one.

    # patch is 14 mm across, one grass tuft 0.28 m, and framing either of them
    # to fill 256 px produces a botanical specimen photograph, not terrain. The
    # shipped whole-import frames failed the other way - `grass_0` and `grass_1`
    # measured 1.1 and 1.2 percent coverage and were statistically identical to
    # each other, because the source is a 17-tuft catalogue laid out in a line
    # along X and a yaw only rotates a line.

# Wild. Trees carry the most silhouette information and earn the most
# headings; ground cover reads the same from every side and earns one.
#
# Where a source ships several finished subjects side by side, the headings
# give way to one of two modes - see the field comments on [class WildBake].
# Measured footprints started the sort: fir 18.78 m and the mossy rock set
# 8.28 m are catalogue rows whose subjects are each worth a frame, so they
# split through `variants`. `dry_branches_medium_01` (1.06 m) and `pine_roots`
# (1.77 m) are genuine clumps at that framing and stay whole.
#
# Footprint alone turned out to be the wrong test for the rest, and each bake
# said so in its own numbers. `shrub_02` measures 5.98 m and split cleanly into
# four subjects through `variants`, and each subject then covered 4.5 percent of
# its own frame because a scan of a real bush is mostly the gaps between its
# branches. It wanted the third mode: `clump`, which composes named subjects
# into one deliberate arrangement rather than accepting the catalogue's.
# `fern_02` and `grass_medium_01` are here for the same reason, composed from
# the layouts the macro probes validated rather than deferred to those probes'
# own renderers.
# Measured, not chosen. One fir subject was rendered at 42.7, 55 and 70 degrees
# of stage elevation and composited over the forest floor: at 42.7 the trunk was
# 40 percent of the sprite and a single pixel wide at the gameplay camera, at 55
# it was a quarter, and at 70 it was a short stub under a canopy that filled the
# frame - the silhouette this game wants, and still enough bole to say tree
# rather than bush. Luma and lit area rose with it (82.8 -> 92.3 -> 104.5,
# 7405 -> 7818 -> 8946 visible pixels), because tipping a conifer toward the
# camera turns edge-on needles into facing ones.
#
# It is declared only on the three pine/fir sources. `tree_small_02` is a wide
# broadleaf whose canopy already dominates at the shared angle, and
# `dead_tree_trunk_02` is the street-lamp case from [class WildBake]: a bare
# bole is a pole, and foreshortening a pole away leaves a disc.
#
# `elevation` is a camera angle and nothing more, which is worth stating because
# it has been misread once. [_frame_asset] rotates the camera by it and leaves
# the three lights at their fixed world offsets, so raising it changes what is
# framed and never what is lit. An earlier attempt moved a ground-cover source
# from 42.66 to 68 degrees expecting its substrate to light up and got a better
# view down into the same unlit crevices; see the rejection note on `moss_01` in
# [const FAMILIES].

# Read out of the glTF rather than off a render: the three variants' mounds
# top out at 0.35, 0.30 and 0.35 m above each trunk's own lowest point, and

# proper radius by 0.60 m. 0.40 clears every mound top with 0.05 m to spare
# and keeps the natural flare above it. 0.45 was baked and measured against
# it at 1x and 6x: one pixel narrower at the foot on variant b, unchanged on
# a and c, one pixel shorter on b and c, and indistinguishable on the sheet -
# so 0.40 ships and 0.45 is recorded as the probe that did not pay.
#
# The consequence for delivered size runs the other way from intuition.
# Cropped to alpha the frames lose 4 to 10 rows, the runtime fits the longer
# edge of the crop to `collision_radius * 4.35`, and the delivered tree is

# The stage has no ground, so it produces no contact ambient occlusion, and the
# family hid that for as long as every subject was wide and low: a rock or a
# fern reads as resting on the floor because its silhouette is already flat
# against it. A tree does not. Repointing the forest canopy onto this atlas put
# a tall narrow subject on the map for the first time and the omission became
# the family's loudest defect - the fir's own root flare, a fully opaque disc
# about 1.2 m across on an 18.9 m tree, measured mean luma 84.5 / 85.8 / 90.1
# against a forest floor of 53.0, so the tree stood on a lit poker chip.
#
# `_apply_silhouette_rim` then converted that into a ring rather than a
# highlight, and the asymmetry is the whole mechanism: the rim ink lands at
# full strength against a hard opaque alpha edge and is diluted to nothing
# against the fuzzy alpha of a leaf card, so a canopy takes a soft line while
# the root flare takes a hard black annulus. Nothing was wrong with the rim,
# with `GroundShadow`, or with the retired procedural tree - all three were
# checked first and all three were innocent.
#
# The first grade multiplied RGB by a smoothstep ramp over the bottom band of
# the subject's own alpha content, flat across the row, to a floor of 0.22. It
# took the fir bases from a lit chip to 54.0 / 56.4 / 28.5, which answered the
# poker chip and produced the next defect: a black puck. A flat row ramp cannot
# tell a trunk from a low branch tier, and at 0.22 it does not need to - the
# rim ink itself is (6, 9, 9), luma 8.4, and 8.4 x 0.22 is 1.85, so the two
# lowest rows of every frame shipped at luma 1.8 to 3.6, under anything the
# game draws. Row profiles say where the rest of the puck came from. fir_1's
# trunk base is 29 px wide (bottom-up rows 174-191) and fir_2's is 27 px
# (167-181), and both sat fully at the floor: a floor problem. fir_0's trunk
# tapers 18 -> 5 px (182-188) under a 33 px low-branch tier (174-181), and
# the tier is what the flat ramp blackened: a lateral problem. The broadleaves
# carry 9 px trunks that are dark in the ungraded source (delivered 28.6 and
# 19.0 against a ground of 50) and pin at the finish shader's own delivered
# floor of about 13 whatever this grade does, so they read as a trunk line
# rather than a puck and are unchanged by any of this.
#
# Delivered numbers are what settled the operator, because a runtime multiply
# (`WorldObstacle2D.WILD_TREE_TINT`) fixed the canopy's hue defect and cannot
# touch a value defect in the same frame: a multiply can only lose value, and
# the puck is baked below the tint's reach. Modelled at the 48/140 the forest
# draws a tree at, through `sleek_sprite_finish` at its forest parameters on a
# luma-50 ground, the shipped bottom three body rows of the five trees sat at
# 15.2 / 15.5 / 16.1 / 17.9 / 15.8 - about 35 under the ground, and 13.0 is the
# shader floor - while the ungraded frames sat at 46.6 / 41.2 / 55.2 / 28.6 /
# 19.0, the firs at ground value, which is the floating foot this grade was
# added for. The operator below is between the two: the same row ramp, times a
# lateral weight that is 1.0 over the columns the subject actually stands on
# (alpha over 0.5 in its lowest `CONTACT_FOOT_DEPTH` of alpha height) and
# falls by smoothstep to 0.0 over `CONTACT_REACH` of alpha height to either
# side, to a floor of 0.60. Swept at floors 0.55 / 0.60 / 0.65, the firs'
# delivered foot lands at 0.58-0.71 / 0.62-0.76 / 0.67-0.81 of a
# `GroundShadow`-darkened ground (50 x 0.74 = 37), and their share of delivered
# band pixels under luma 20 at 15.0-23.2 / 12.0-18.8 / 9.8-16.0 percent against
# 24.5-59.8 shipped. 0.60 is the one that keeps every fir foot below its
# shadowed ground and every fir band share under 20 percent; 0.65 puts fir_2 at
# 0.81 of it, which is a foot at ground value again. Reach 0.12 was tried and
# rejected: it costs the low branches about 3 luma more than 0.06 and is not
# distinguishable from it at delivered size. Off-axis branch luma at the
# shipped reach matches the ungraded frame to within 1 luma on every tree.
#
# The rim rows are graded with everything else and land at 8.4 x 0.60 = 5.0.
# That is under the Void charcoal 8.4 CLAUDE.md 8 reserves for outlines, and
# it is the outline, so nothing else in the frame is under it. Excluding rim
# pixels from the grade was considered and not done, because a grade that
# skips one ink value is a grade that changes shape when the ink does.
#
# It is one shared constant set rather than a per-source column, for the reason
# CLAUDE.md 9 records about `COOL_RIM_ENERGY`: this corrects a deficiency of the
# shared stage, and a stage correction that has to be re-authored per subject is
# a stage correction that will be wrong on the next subject added. The lateral
# term is not a per-subject constant either: it is measured off each frame's

    `band` is the fraction of the subject's own alpha height the row ramp
    spans, so a fir and a fern are graded over the same proportion of
    themselves rather than the same pixel count. `floor` is the multiplier
    reached at the contact row over the footprint. `hold` shortens the ramp's
    rise within that span, leaving the lowest rows fully at `floor` instead of
    only touching it on the last row - without it the darkest value exists on
    one row and the foot still reads lit.

    The row ramp is multiplied by a lateral weight so the grade darkens the
    trunk and not the branch tier above it. The footprint is the set of
    columns carrying alpha over 0.5 in the lowest `foot_depth` of the alpha
    height, at least two rows; the weight is 1.0 over those columns and falls
    by smoothstep to 0.0 at `reach` of the alpha height from the nearest one.
    A subject whose lowest rows are all faint - nothing over 0.5 - takes the
    flat row ramp, which is the previous behaviour.

    Orientation matters and is the opposite of the obvious: Blender's
    `Image.pixels` starts at the bottom-left, so the subject's foot is at the
    *smallest* row index here, while the same array read out of PIL would put
    it at the largest. Grading the wrong end darkens the canopy and leaves the
    defect untouched.

    Alpha is deliberately not written. The atlas packer derives
    `content_bounds`, `padded_atlas_region` and every runtime region table from
    alpha alone, so a pure RGB grade cannot move a sprite's placement or
    invalidate a region constant that already ships. Outside the ramp's rows
    the multiplier is exactly 1.0, so a rebake differs from the previous one
    only inside the band and the difference can be checked as such.

    """Render an individual frame until it lands inside the family value band.

    Moss, bark, and a black trashbag are valid dark subjects, but a subject
    darker than the ground it will stand on is not a dark subject, it is a hole.
    The loop therefore aims at the measured band in [wild_bake_contract] rather
    than at the packer's hard floor, and it corrects in both directions: a
    stump photographed in sun is as wrong for this world as a rock photographed
    in shade, and only one of those two errors used to be caught.

    The correction is intentionally per frame: it preserves the shared stage
    while preventing one dark prior source from drifting every following source
    brighter.

    Two different values are measured here and conflating them is a trap worth
    naming, because both halves of it have now been got wrong. The exposure
    decision reads the frame after [func _apply_silhouette_rim] and before
    [func _apply_contact_grade]; the returned stats read the finished file,
    because the manifest and the packer's hard floor describe what actually
    ships.

    The grade is excluded because the band exists to correct how Poly Haven
    photographed a source, and an authored contact shadow is not that.
    Measuring the exposure off the graded frame would buy a canopy brightness
    to pay for a shadow at its feet.

    The rim is included because the band was calibrated with the rim in it,
    and that is the part that was got wrong. Excluding the rim as well looks
    like the same argument - it is also authored, not photographed - but the
    rim was never outside the target the numbers in [wild_bake_contract] were
    measured against, so dropping it silently re-pointed the whole band.
    Because the rim only darkens, the pre-rim value reads brighter, the loop
    read that as overexposure and pulled the stage down: a third of a stop off
    every source, canopy included. It was legible in the profile as a constant
    ratio at 35, 50 and 75 percent of subject height, where the contact ramp is
    exactly zero and nothing should have moved at all - `fir_0` at 0.84
    everywhere above the band, `shrub_0` down from 71.2 to 45.4 against a hard
    floor of 34. `rock_bare_0` was the control that made it obvious: alone in
    the family it held 1.00 above the band, because its silhouette is compact
    enough that the rim costs it almost nothing. Re-calibrating the band would
    not have worked either, since a hard alpha edge takes the rim's ink at full
    strength while a fuzzy canopy dilutes it, so the offset is per subject.

    `district._frame_asset` floors the span it fits to at 0.75 m, which is a
    guard against degenerate geometry and against an ortho_scale small enough to
    lose precision. Ground cover is genuinely smaller than that guard: a moss mat
    composed at source-real size spans 47 mm, so the routine framed it as though
    it were sixteen times larger and the bake landed 282 lit pixels in a 256 px
    frame - a speck with 117 px of empty margin on every side. Grass hit the same
    floor less severely at 0.60 m.

    Scaling the composition is the correct answer rather than lowering the floor,
    and it is exact rather than approximate. The camera is orthographic, so the
    rendered pixels are invariant to a uniform scale of the whole set; the only
    parts of the rig that read a size are the light distance and the light area,
    and both are themselves floored (`max(exact_span * 0.38, 0.72)` and
    `max(base_size, exact_span * 0.72)`) for every span up to 1.89 m. A clump
    below the framing floor is therefore below the lighting floors both before
    and after, and this scales the framing without touching the light.

    The target is a world dimension rather than the projected span the camera
    actually measures, because that span is not known until the camera has been
    placed from these bounds. At the stage's 42.66-degree elevation the worst
    projection of a world extent is sin(42.66) = 0.678, so a largest-dimension
    target of 1.25 m guarantees a projected span of at least 0.85 - clear of the
    0.75 floor with margin, without needing to solve the placement twice.

    Clumps already larger than the target are left exactly alone: `fern` at 1.3 m
    and `shrub_a` at 2.59 m frame correctly today, and normalising them *down*
    would drop them under the lighting floors and change their exposure.
