## Focused gate for weight: the shove a landed hit imparts, and the bar it moves.
##
## Both exist so a hit is felt rather than merely accounted for, and both are the
## kind of thing that looks correct in a screenshot and is broken in motion. The
## contracts held here are the ones a play session would take a long time to
## expose.
##
## The first is that the shove is integrated in the attack branch at all. That
## branch used to zero the velocity and skip move_and_slide entirely, so the one
## body a hit could not move was a body already chewing on the player - which is
## exactly where impact has to read. A test that only shoved an enemy standing in
## open ground would have passed against the broken version.
##
## The second is that a rooted body does not slide. Damage is applied before the
## status in the trap path, so the impulse is always banked before the root
## exists; only suppression at integration keeps a Razor Snare from flinging its
## own victim out of its trigger radius and never rearming.
##
## The third is that the bar reaches clients. Host and client write health
## through entirely separate paths - the simulation on one, the replicated
## snapshot on the other - and a bar wired to only one of them is invisible on
## half the screens in the session.

## Long enough for a shove at the damage cap to travel and still be fully spent.
## Physics deltas are fixed at the tick rate, so this is a duration, not a race.
const IMPACT_FRAMES: int = 40
## A blow at the authored reference, so weight is exactly 1.0 and the arithmetic
## under test is the mass table rather than the damage curve.
