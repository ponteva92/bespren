## A landed hit shoves the body. This changes no health total and no damage

## in the hand. A crawler pack scatters off a single round, a shield braces, a
## goliath rocks and keeps coming. That is the eight identities of CLAUDE.md 7
## taught through the trigger in the first magazine rather than through a
## health bar draining at eight different rates.
