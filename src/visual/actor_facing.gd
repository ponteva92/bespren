class_name ActorFacing
extends RefCounted
## Maps a screen-space heading onto one of the eight rows of a baked actor sheet.
##
## The bake turns an actor once around its own vertical axis in eight equal
## world-space steps and renders each step as a sheet row. Those steps are equal
## in the world; they are not equal on screen. The stage camera sits at 52
## degrees of elevation, which compresses the screen-vertical axis by sin(52) =
## 0.788, so the heading one step off "straight down" lands at 38.24 degrees from
## the horizontal rather than at 45.
##
## Picking a row by slicing an angle into eight equal wedges would therefore hand
## a diagonal sprite to a heading up to seven degrees away from the one it was
## rendered for, and an actor moving along a shallow diagonal would visibly point
## somewhere other than where it is going. Scoring against the measured headings
## instead makes the row selection agree with the projection the renderer
## actually used.
##
## The vectors below are that projection, evaluated for each row and confirmed
## against the baked pixels: row 0 walks screen-left, row 2 walks toward the
## camera, row 4 screen-right, row 6 away. Godot 2D screen space, so +Y is down.

## The heading that faces the camera. An actor with no known facing should use
## this one - it shows the player a face rather than a back.
