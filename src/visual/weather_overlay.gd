class_name WeatherOverlay
extends ColorRect
## Full-screen atmospheric pass designed for a single Mobile canvas draw.
##
## It also carries the damage response, because the mobile budget in CLAUDE.md 10
## allows one full-screen custom pass and says to combine atmosphere into this
## shader rather than stack a second. A survivor being hit therefore raises a
## uniform here instead of instantiating an overlay of his own, which also means
## weather and damage composite once instead of blending over each other.

## Peak strength of the hit wash. Short of 1.0 deliberately: the frame edge
## going fully opaque red would hide the horde closing in from off-centre, which
## is the information a hit is supposed to make the player go looking for.
const DAMAGE_PEAK: float = 0.82
## Fractions per second. About half a second from a full hit back to clear -
## long enough to register, short enough that a second hit lands on a clean
## frame rather than compounding into a permanent red screen.
