## The dirt family is the asphalt family's warm counterpart, scaled to sit where
## a worn path belongs in the value hierarchy rather than where it was authored.
## `65533f` measured luma 86.0 against a forest floor of 50.7 - 1.7 times the
## ground - and in `world_forest_rock_validation.png` the path was the brightest
## large mass in the frame, pulling harder than the rock it ran past. A landmark
## the player navigates by has to out-read the background it sits on, and
## CLAUDE.md 8 reserves the dominant warm mass for the Base Core. Every dirt
## constant below is the authored colour times 0.77, which puts the bed at luma
## 65.9: still thirty percent brighter than the forest floor, so it reads as a
## cleared track, but no longer the loudest thing in the wilderness.

## Surface-detail cadence, in world units along and across the carriageway. The
## road bed used to be a single `draw_polyline` in one flat colour, and measured
## off the capture set that made it the largest dead area in the game: row y=105
## of `world_mall_validation.png` was 480 identical pixels, and `363d3b` alone
## covered 20 to 27 percent of five city frames while `65533f` covered 19 percent
## of `world_forest_rock_validation.png`. Those captures sit at zoom 0.176, so at
## the 0.38 gameplay zoom the 420-unit bed is 160 of the screen's 270 rows and a
## player standing on a road saw well over half the frame under three flat fills.
## The spacings below are chosen against that zoom rather than against the
## capture: 52 units is about 20 screen pixels, so the aggregate lands inside the
## 7-pixel window the local-contrast metric samples with, and the marks stay in
## the 2-to-100-cycles-per-frame band that survives to the display at all.
## Rut geometry. The two dark tracks used to be a pair of `draw_line` calls at a
## fixed offset in one colour, which drew them as two dead-straight full-length
## lines of constant depth - measured off the forest-density capture they were
## the most geometric thing in the frame, more so than the road boundary the
## verge pass had just been rewritten for. A wheel track wanders, deepens where
## the ground is soft and fades where it is hard, so it is now sampled along the
## road and given a smooth lateral wander and a smooth depth. The wander period
## is long against the sample spacing so the track curves rather than zigzags,
## and the depth period is shorter so it breaks more often than it turns.

## How far a wear patch outline may leave the quadrilateral it is built from.
## The quad is the point - CLAUDE.md 2 asks decay to tell history and a patch is
## the only mark in this file that implies a hand - but drawn with four vertices
## it has four exactly straight edges, two of them square to the road, and on the
## capture it reads as a rectangle laid on the surface rather than as a repair
## poured into it. Dirt takes the larger share because a puddle has no hand
## behind it at all.
## The road bed and its shoulder used to be two `draw_polyline` calls, which is
## the reason nine perfectly parallel lines showed up in the asphalt capture: two
## shoulder rails, two painted edges, four wheel bands and the dash row, every one
## of them at a constant offset for the whole length of the frame. A polyline is
## the wrong primitive for a surface that has been eroding for a decade. Both
## bands are polygons now, sampled every `BAND_SAMPLE_SPACING` units, with each
## side of each band carrying its own smooth noise so the four boundaries never
## move together. The outer edge is given the larger amplitude and the longer
## period because it is the one that meets untended ground; the inner edge is the
## drier crown of a maintained surface and wanders less.
## The wheel bands and the painted edges drift with the carriageway rather than
## with the noise the band edges use, so a lane never crosses the line beside it.
## The paint is given the inner band own period for its lateral wander, because a
## line painted along a road follows that road edge; only its wear is its own.

## of `OUTER_EDGE_WANDER` past the nominal edge on its own: the marks now target
## the boundary where it actually is rather than where the width says it is, so a
## budget sized for the nominal edge would have spent itself on the wander and
## left the clamp pulling every mark back off the boundary it was aimed at.

## half a grit spacing plus a break mark's own half length plus half its width,
## which is 18 + 30 + 6.5. Steering the break strokes along the road is what put
## that second figure up: a mark that runs across the edge spends its length on
## the padding across the road instead, so the budget had to move with it.

## The grain material. One `ShaderMaterial` per road type is shared by every

	## Dust drifted onto the carriageway from the verge, and the marks that break

	## therefore exact straight lines, and in a world whose art direction is
	## granular decay a perfectly clean boundary was the tell that the road was a
	## drawn shape rather than a surface.
	##
	## Softening them was already the intent here, and measured off
	## `world_forest_density_validation.png` it was doing 0.4 percent of the job:
	## the dirt outer-to-inner boundary still stepped by more than six luma on 269
	## of 270 rows, and the column of maximum gradient held a standard deviation of
	## 0.468 pixels over the whole frame height - a ruler. Two causes compound.
	##
	## Placement: `lateral` ranged over world 159 to 216 while the outer boundary
	## sits at 240, so that edge received no mark at all, and the marks that did
	## land sat beside the inner edge rather than across it. A mark that does not
	## cross a line cannot break it, so each mark now picks one of the two
	## boundaries and straddles it.
	##
	## Value: `SHOULDER_GRIT_COLOR` measures luma 99 and composites to 58.5 over the
	## shoulder and 75.9 over the bed - brighter than both sides of every step it was
	## asked to hide. A mark brighter than the two values it spans adds a third value
	## instead of blending them, which is why it read as sprinkles lying on a clean
	## line rather than as a worn edge. The verge colours sit between each family's
	## own two values, so a straddling mark lands near their midpoint from either
	## side and one 25-luma cliff becomes two 12-luma steps with a ragged seam
	## between them. The bright dust is kept for the marks that stay inside the
	## shoulder, where being the brightest thing present is what it is for.
	##
	## Reach: the first version of this rewrite still could not touch the outer
	## boundary, and for a reason worth stating rather than quietly fixing. It
	## clamped the mark centre to `outer_edge + 2 - half_stroke - width * 0.5`,
	## which puts the mark's outermost pixel one unit *inside* the edge it was
	## aimed at - the placement bug rewritten as an arithmetic one. That two came
	## from the culling rectangle, which had no room to give, so `configure` now
	## pads along and across the road separately and `VERGE_BREAK_REACH` is real
	## budget the clamp can spend.
	##
	## Coverage: straddling every boundary still left the bed edge holding its
	## full authored 23.9-luma step on 96.3 percent of rows, because a mark can be
	## in the right place and still be too small to matter. An even three-way role
	## split put one mark per 108 world units on the inner edge, each of them six
	## units wide - about one screen pixel at the shipped zoom - and two to five
	## long. Interrupting a line is a question of what fraction of its length is
	## covered, not of whether anything sits on it anywhere.
	##
	## So a break mark is now a different object from a speck of dust and is drawn
	## in its own batch with its own width. It is more than twice as wide, because
	## what has to reach across the boundary is the stroke's width; it is steered
	## to within a third of a radian of the road, so its length runs along the edge
	## it is eating into rather than sticking out into the bed; it is longer; and
	## the inner boundary takes the larger share of the roles, since the two
	## road-to-forest edges already have the scatter standing on them and this one
	## has nothing else working on it.
	##
	## Jitter is scaled to the stroke rather than to the shoulder. A break mark
	## offset by up to half the shoulder can miss its boundary entirely; offset by
	## no more than half its own width it always spans it, and the variety comes
	## from length, angle and along-road position instead. The clamp is computed
	## from the stroke's actual lateral extent rather than from its length, so a
	## mark lying along the edge is not dragged inward for reach it never asked
	## for, and where the clamp does bind it pulls the mark back onto the boundary
	## rather than off it.
