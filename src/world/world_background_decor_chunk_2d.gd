## Regional custom-draw batch for non-colliding decor on the background pass.

## Moss is a stain on the ground, so it is built the way [GroundShadow] builds a
## contact: overlapping lobes of low-alpha steps whose union has no edge, rather
## than one shape at one opacity.
##
## It used to be `draw_circle` at 0.42 plus a `draw_arc` rim, and in
## `artifacts/world_forest_density_validation.png` that read as exactly what it
## was - a flat translucent disc with a lighter lip, the most geometric shape in a
## naturalistic frame. The rim was the worse half: a 12 segment arc is a visible
## dodecagon, and drawing it *lighter* than the fill turned a ground stain into a
## raised pad.
##
## Alpha is per step. Six steps overlap to about 0.45 at the core, which holds the
## value the old flat fill had, and fall to a single 0.096 step at the fringe,
## which is what removes the edge.
##
## The steps used to be circles, and the claim above them - that rotating three
## lobes stops 220 patches sharing one silhouette - was true about the rotation
## and false about the silhouette, because a rotated circle is the same circle.
## The lobe centres sat within 0.22 of the patch centre with radii of 0.62 to
## 0.74, so their union's radial extent ran from 0.84 to 0.92 of the radius: a
## five percent departure from a disc, in a frame where the disc was the only
## geometric shape. `draw_circle` cannot express a moss patch for the same reason
## `draw_polyline` could not express a decade of road erosion - the primitive has
## no way to say where the growth stopped. Each step is now a thirteen-point
## polygon whose radius carries three broad lobes and five finer ones at
## independent phases, so its outline runs from 0.69 to 1.31 of nominal and no two
## steps break in the same places. `draw_colored_polygon` takes concave outlines
## in Godot 4, which is the whole reason the shape can now have notches.
## Held at the forest floor's own value on purpose, so moss reads as a hue shift
## rather than a bright patch.
##
## The value was retuned here too, on a measurement that turned out to be of
## something else. A luma 88.7 blob in that capture was read as the moss and the
## fill was darkened to chase it; the next capture moved it by 0.13 L, which is
## the proof it was never moss. It was [constant PROP_FOLIAGE] below, whose
## `lightened(0.08)` lobe composites to 84 on the same ground. The darker fill is
## kept anyway, on its own merit rather than the borrowed one: a stain that sits
## at the floor's own 0.208 relative luma reads as a hue shift in the dirt, which
## is what moss is, and that is the correction [constant FOLIAGE_COOL] already
## took - differ by hue, stay inside the world's value band.

## bones reached 106, mushroom caps 97, barrel steel 78. A player scanning for the
## refuge or for salvage should not be pulled to litter, which is what CLAUDE.md 8
## means by reserving the high-value islands.
##
## Hue and shape still carry each identity, per CLAUDE.md 11: bone stays the
## palest and the only warm one, growth stays the only yellow-green and keeps its
## three-cap cluster, steel stays cool-neutral under its rust ring.

## Every prop in this class stood on nothing. [GroundShadow]'s own docstring names
## the gap - nine obstacle kinds "and every background decoration, drew nothing" -
## and this is the background-decoration half of it: 420 props, among them the 75
## benches, 46 hydrants and 34 stoves the district gate counts here, all of them
## floating a shade above a floor they are supposed to be standing on.
##
## Rotation is dropped deliberately. The ellipse is a horizontal footprint under a
## vertical object, so it turns mostly in the axis the flatten has already
## collapsed; and the three kinds whose silhouette is genuinely directional lie
## flat on the ground and are given no contact at all.
